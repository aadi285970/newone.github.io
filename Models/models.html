	<h2>INTERIOR</h2>
	<p>In the Lamborghini Urus interior, luxurious Italian craftsmanship meets state-of-the-art technology. The aeronautic design and the driver-oriented instrument concept with three TFT screens (one for the instruments, one for infotainment and one for comfort functions, including virtual keyboard feature with hand-writing recognition) put the driver’s needs at the forefront and make the overall experience more comfortable and enjoyable. The dashboard architecture follows the “Y” theme inspired by iconic Lamborghini models. The interior can be customized, starting from the five-seater architecture with bench seat, or four seats with two individual back seats, and be made even more elegant or sportier, through the selection of different kinds of colors and materials, such as: natural leather, Alcantara®, wood finish, aluminum or carbon – with the option for further sophistication on select materials through contrast stitching or Q-citura. Urus features the largest range of options ever presented on a Lamborghini , with multiple souls converging to create a unique vehicle. Furthermore, Lamborghini Urus is the first five-seater super sports car.</p></div>
